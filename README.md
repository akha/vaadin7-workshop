![Vaadin logo](src/site/vaadin.jpg)

This Vaadin 7 workshop intends to demonstrate some capabilities of Vaadin in general and Vaadin 7 in particular.

## License and terms of use
The project is licensed under the terms of GPL v3, although if you use it - as you're encouraged to do, I would appreciate if you would:

* mention [this Github project](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/)
* give [me](https://github.com/nfrankel) credit in your slides
* ping me so that I know who uses it

Feedback and contributions are also much appreciated!

## Demoed features

Features are presented in a step-by-step way. A tag demoes a specific feature (or a tight group thereof):

| Tag |Â Feature |
|-----|---------|
|[v0.0](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/tree/v0.0) | Project generated with Vaadin Maven archetype, but cleaned up to only provide what's necessary
|[v0.1](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/tree/v0.1) | Introduces components, layouts, title
|[v0.2](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/tree/v0.2) | Proposes an application architecture example, with reusable components
|[v0.3](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/tree/v0.3) | Introduces "screen" switch
|[v0.4](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/tree/v0.4) | Complete event listener model implementation
|[v0.5](https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/tree/v0.5) | True push, broadcasted to all clients

By checkouting the desired tag, you can get the state of the project with just the desired state:

    git checkout tag v0.2

For broadcast push, which is not trivial, here's a class diagram:

## Going further

If at this point, you're interested to go further into Vaadin, I would suggest some of my personal resources:

* [morevaadin.com](http://morevaadin.com) contains a number of articles on a single dedicated subject
* [Learning Vaadin 7](http://www.packtpub.com/learning-vaadin-7-second-edition/book) is a whole book dedicated to learning Vaadin 7 from the ground up
